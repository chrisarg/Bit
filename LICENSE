Adaptation of the original Bit_T library for aligned memory allocation, 
extented op_count operations (where op is one of inter(section), union, minus,
diff(erence) using optimized intrinsics instructions for AVX512, AVX2, SSE,
NEON, SVE, PPC64, RVV architectures by adapting code contained in libpopcnt.h 
and sse-popcount.
