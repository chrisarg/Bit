    Provides an interface to
    1) a BIT_T type and a set of functions to manipulate it.

    The Bit_T is a simple uncompressed bitset implementation based
    on David Hanson's "C Interfaces and Implementations" book

    This is not a general bitset library, i.e. one cannot grow the bitset.
    Bitsets are also limited in capacity to int (at the time of the
    writting the same size as uint32_t). If one needs larger bitsets, then
    they should probably be using roaring or compressed bitsets.

    Functions that create, free or load an externally created bitset into a T.
    * Bit_new           : Create a new bitset with a fixed capacity/length
                          The code uses the best alignment possible for the
                          platform (e.g. 64 bytes on x86_64)
    * Bit_free          : Free the bitset and zeros the pointer for safe
                          deallocation (if the space for the bit was allocated
                          by the library). Returns the address of the storage
                          if allocated externally, or NULL if the
                          bitset was allocated by the library.
    * Bit_load          : Load an externally allocated bitset into a (new) T
    * Bit_extract       : Extract the bitset from a T into an externally
                          allocated buffer. Returns the number of bytes written.


    Functions that obtain the properties of a bitset:
    * Bit_length        : Return the length (or capacity) of the bitset (bits)
    * Bit_count         : Count the number of bits set in the bitset
    * Bit_buffer_size   : Return the number of bytes needed to store the
                          individual bits of the bitset of a given length

    Functions that manipulate the bitset:
    * Bit_aset          : Set an array of bits in the bitset to one
    * Bit_bset          : Set a bit in the bitset to one
    * Bit_aclear        : Clear an array of bits in the bitset
    * Bit_bclear        : Clear a bit in the bitset
    * Bit_clear         : Clears a range of bits [lo,hi] in the bitset
    * Bit_get           : Get the value of a bit in the bitset
    * Bit_map           : Applies a function to each bit in the bitset. The
    *                     function *may* change the bitset in place. Note that
    *                     as a function is applied from left to right, the
    *                     changes will be seen by subsequent calls
    * Bit_not           : Inverts a range of bits [lo,hi] in the bitset
    * Bit_put           : Set a bit in the bitset to a value & returns the
                          previous value of the bit
    * Bit_set           : Sets a range of bits [lo,hi] in the bitset to one

    Functions that compare bitsets:
    * Bit_eq            : Compare two bitsets for equality (=1)
    * Bit_leq           : Compare two bitsets for less than or equal (=1)
    * Bit_lt            : Compare two bitsets for less than (=1)

    Functions that operate on sets of bitsets (and create a new one):
    * Bit_inter         : Perform an intersection operation with another bitset
    * Bit_diff          : Perform a difference operation, logical AND
    * Bit_minus         : Perform a symmetric difference operation, ie the XOR
    * Bit_union         : Perform a union operation with another bitset


    Functions that perform counts on set operations of two bitsets:
    * Bit_diff_count    : Count the number of bits set in the difference
    * Bit_inter_count   : Count the number of bits set in the intersection
    * Bit_minus_count   : Count the number of bits set in the symmetric
                          difference
    * Bit_union_count   : Count the number of bits set in the union

    ===========================================================================

    The Bit_T_DB is a packed container of Bit_T and thus contains only
    a few functions to manipulate it.

    * BitDB_new         : Create a new packed container of bitsets
    * BitDB_free        : Free the packed container of bitsets
    * BitDB_length      : Get the number of bitsets in the packed container.
    * BitDB_count_at    : Population count at a given index in the container.
    * BitDB_nelem       : Get the number of bitsets in the packed container.
    * BitDB_count       : Population count of all bitsets in the container.

    * BitDB_clear_at    : Clear a bitset at a given index in the packed
                          container.
    * BitDB_clear       : Clear all bitsets in the packed container.
    * BitDB_get_from    : Returns a bitset from the bytes at a given index.
    * BitDB_put_at      : Set a bit in the bitset at a given index in the packed
                          container to the contents of another bitset.
    * BitDB_extract_from: Extract a bitset from the packed container at a given
   index into an externally allocated buffer. Returns the number of bytes
   written. The buffer must be large enough to hold the bitset (so please ensure
   that you use Bit_buffer_size(BitDB_length(set)) to obtain the size of the
   buffer you need).

    * BitDB_replace_at   : Replace a bitset in the packed container at a given
   index with the contents of a buffer.
    * BitDB_insert_at    : Insert a new bitset into the packed container at
    *                     a given index.

    * BitDB_SETOP_count : Count the number of bits set in the SETOP
                          of all the bitsets in the container with all the
                          bitsets in another container. This is a macro that
                          expands to a function that takes two containers,
                          a structure for various control options and a target
                          that is their the token cpu or gpu. The actual
                          functions are BitDB_inter_count_cpu and
                          BitDB_inter_count_gpu.

    * BitDB_SETOP_count_store : Count the number of bits set in the SETOP
                          of all the bitsets in the container with all the
                          bitsets in another container. This is a macro that
                          expands to a function that takes two containers,
                          a structure for various control options and a target
                          pre-allocated buffer to store the results and a target
                          that is their the token cpu or gpu. The actual
                          functions are BitDB_inter_count_store_cpu and
                          BitDB_inter_count_store_gpu.

    > SETOP can be one of the following:
        1. inter = intersection
        2. union = union
        3. diff = difference
        4. minus = symmetric difference

    DANGER: While the load functions will write the appropriate number of bytes
    to the buffer, the caller is responsible for ensuring that the buffer is
    large enough to hold the results. Extreme (sprintf level) FAFO may obtain
    in the form of security bugs and buffer overflows if the user fails to
   ensure the buffer is adequately sized.

   NOTE that the macro functions are not callable if one is to compile this
   into a dynamic library, as the macro expansion will not be visible. In this
   case one has to call the functions directly, e.g. BitDB_inter_count_cpu
   or BitDB_inter_count_store_cpu.
